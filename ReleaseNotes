This is a feature release of JSPWiki.

Major changes since the last release are:

- PageInfo can now display older versions directly as well, not just
  diffs.

- Some cosmetic enhancements.

- Wiki can now handle non-ASCII WikiNames as well.  Both the URL
  linking scheme and the FileProviders were changed.

- Added footnotes (see included TextFormattingRules.txt in
  jspwiki-samplepages.zip for info)

- The left hand menu is now editable with a special page called
  "LeftMenu" (surprise =).

- Slight bug fixes (thanks to Kim Holviala, Erik Bunn, Chris
  Brooking).

- Default setup should now be easier, since there is no more default
  access restriction, and the default provider is FileSystemProvider.
  Also, the default logging method was changed.

- index.html was removed for a better solution (see web.xml)


UPGRADE NOTES
=============

* The default jspwiki.properties has changed.  You might want to see
  what's different.

* Integrate the changes from web.xml - they allow you to get rid of
  index.html and the redirection.

* Check the new jspwiki-samplepages directory.  They contain new
  versions of TextFormattingRules and other pages as well.

* Wiki.jsp, LeftMenu.jsp, PageInfo.jsp, Edit.jsp, PageHeader.jsp,
  PageModified.jsp, Search.jsp, RecentChanges.jsp, and all of the CSS
  files have changed much since v1.4.0, mostly due to support for
  non-ASCII page names.

  Sorry about any inconvinience.  I think you'll find that most of the
  modifications were actually helpful, especially if you're running a
  non-english Wiki.
