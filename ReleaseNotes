This is a stable release of JSPWiki 2.6.  Welcome to the new, all-seeing,
all-dancing, all-spanking JSPWiki!

This is the final release of JSPWiki as LGPL software.  The development of
JSPWiki moves to the Apache Incubation process, and in the future, you can
find JSPWiki from the Apache website.  For more information, please see
http://www.jspwiki.org/wiki/ApacheRelicensing.

Please report any issues you can find at http://issues.apache.org/JIRA/

NEW FEATURES
============

* JSPWiki source code requires JDK 1.5 to compile, though it should
  still run under JDK 1.4.

* Workflow packages (e.g. for moderating page edits or registrations)

* Internationalization.  Included are English, Finnish, German and Spanish
  translations.

* Spaces in wikinames are now allowed for a more natural-looking page content.
  However, this does not break existing links - but names with spaces are
  preferred.

* Support for new link target types, e.g. [cool link|http://google.com|target='_blank']
  to open the link in a new window.

* SisterSites support

* Local security policies - no more need to use a global security policy
  to configure JSPWiki security!

* Improved SpamFilter, including Captcha support (currently only supports ASIRRA)

* Far improved FCK WYSIWYG editor support

* All new default template with all sorts of awesome goodies, such as upload
  progress indicator, etc!  It is based on the ever-popular BrushedTemplate!

* No more JAR signing!  Unfortunately, though, if you're running JSPWiki with
  a global security policy, you will still need to sign the JAR yourself using
  the "ant signjar" command.
  
This is just a quick overview.  The full list of what is new in 2.6 can be seen at

UPGRADE NOTES
=============

Upgrading from 2.4:

* Reinstall in a new directory

* You can copy old templates directly to the new templates
  directory.  Templates should be for the most part be compatible
  between 2.6 and 2.4 - though obviously most 2.4 templates do
  not have localization.
  
* Copy old jspwiki.properties over the default jspwiki.properties
  and everything should just work.

* Copy old filters.xml to new WEB-INF/classes directory

* Optional: check your jspwiki.policy file against the new one:
  some definitions have changed.
  

Upgrading from earlier installations:

* Please make a complete reinstall.  Your wiki pages will still be
  compatible, and the configuration for the most part.

Please visit http://doc.jspwiki.org/2.4/ for further instructions.



EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
=====================

There are some features in this release which could mostly be considered
experimental at best.  The following ones are known to work only
partially:

* WebDAV support.  This is known to be broken on pretty many levels...


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

* WebDav does not yet support the new
  authentication/permissions scheme.  Therefore, if you have very
  sensitive data in your wiki, you might not want to enable it.

* Not all old plugins work.  Specifically, plugins from 2.2, which
  1) use com.ecyrd.jspwiki package, will fail because they are not
     signed with the same key as jspwiki.jar, and
  2) any plugin, which constructs new WikiPages will fail because
     of the constructor has been changed.

* The default template does not work at all if you turn off
  Javascript.  We are aware of this and working on a fix.

* Our documentation simply sucks at this point.  Please forgive us,
  and point where those fixes are needed.  We will improve upon
  this during our progress towards a stable.

* The ShortURLConstructor does not work reliably.  Please use
  ShortViewURLConstructor, or Apache mod_rewrite.
