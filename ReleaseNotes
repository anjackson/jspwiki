This is a CVS release of JSPWiki.

Major changes since the last stable (1.8.2) release are:

- Support for traditional WikiLinks without square brackets
  (InterCapping, BumpyWords, CamelCase, ...)

- Splitting of Wiki pages into "Controller" and "View" pages has
  been done.  The user-modifiable HTML templates can be found in
  "templates/default" -directory.

- There is a new addition to WikiLanguage: Definition lists
  ;term;definition.  You can use this to make comments, too, by using
  an empty 'term': ;:Comment.

- There is a new variable system, documented in WikiVariables.

- Default Edit window background has been changed :-)

- Many pages have had slight changes to the way they look.

- UserPreferences now checks for username validity. 

- New plugins:
   * IndexPlugin (by Alain Ravet)

UPGRADE NOTES
=============

(NB: These notes are still incomplete).

- If updating manually (from v1.8.0):

  * Providers now sleep in a different package.  You must change your
    "jspwiki.pageProvider" setting.

  * CachingProvider is no longer set explicitly.  You must use the new
    "jspwiki.usePageCache" property instead.

  * All HTML code should now go into *Template.jsp instead of Wiki.jsp
    and the other main JSP pages.

  * SystemInfo.jsp is gone.  Instead, there is now a page called
    "SystemInfo".
