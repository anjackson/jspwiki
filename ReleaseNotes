Welcome to the stable version of JSPWiki 3.0!

This is the first version of JSPWiki which is released completely under
the Apache License.  This is done as a part of the transition to the
Apache Incubation.

Please report any issues you can find at http://issues.apache.org/JIRA/


NEW FEATURES
============

* JSPWiki now requires at least JDK 1.5 to run.

* Simplified Chinese, Dutch, Russian and Italian localizations added!

* Logging by JSPWiki is now done with slf4j, see http://www.slf4j.org for details.
  You can now decide at runtime which logging implementation you want, just pick
  the right slf4j implementation and drop it in WEB-INF/lib
  The default implementation is log4j, so you don't have to switch to anything else unless 
  you have a good reason.
  The log4j configuration statements have been moved to a separate file log4j.properties, 
  this file should be on your CLASSPATH, by default it is placed in WEB-INF/classes
  
* Plugins
	
	New plugins were added:
	- The PluginIndexPlugin shows you all plugins that are available.
	- The InterWikiLinksPlugin shows you all defined InterWikiLinks in a customizable manner.
	
	The IndexPlugin has a new parameter (showAttachments=true/false), use false if you don't
	want attachments to show up on the PageIndex page.
	
	The IndexPlugin, RecentChangesPlugin and ReferredPagesPlugin are now subclasses of AbstractFilteredPlugin
	and therefore inheret the parameters exclude and include, so you can now use these filters.

UPGRADE NOTES
=============

Please see the UPGRADING document in this same directory.


EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
=====================

KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

* URLs for Stripes actions currently use the default .action URLs, rather than URLs
that conform to ShortURL/ShortView/JSP formats. This will be fixed later in the 3.0
development cycle, when we create our own ActionResolver implementation. This will
read URL patterns from a configuration file, instead of being hard-coded.

* When WikiPages are parsed, ACL entries are extracted and removed from the page markup,
and persisted as JCR attributes. This occurs when the page is loaded and parsed by
JSPWikiMarkupParser, and when the page is saved. The intent is to begin moving ACL
information out of the page entirely, and into separate storage. However, we do not
yet have a GUI for manipulating the ACL once it has been extracted. This will come
later in the 3.0 development cycle. 

* JCRPage implements the Attachment interface, in addition to WikiPage. This means that
code snippets like "p instanceof Attachment" will NOT work reliably. You should instead
use the WikiPage.isAttachment() method to test for this condition instead.

* Dummy page names like "__PAGEHERE__" and "#$%" in JavaScript and JSPs have
been replaced with "Main". They were throwing PageNotFoundExceptions. It's
probable that Stripes will eliminate the need to do this, anyway.
