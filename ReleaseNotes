Welcome to the stable version of JSPWiki 3.0!

This is the first version of JSPWiki which is released completely under
the Apache License.  This is done as a part of the transition to the
Apache Incubation.

Please report any issues you can find at http://issues.apache.org/JIRA/


NEW FEATURES
============

* JSPWiki now requires JDK 1.5 to run.

* Simplified Chinese, Dutch, Russian and Italian localizations added!

* Logging by JSPWiki is now done with slf4j, see http://www.slf4j.org for details.
  You can now decide at runtime which logging implementation you want, just pick
  the right slf4j implementation and drop it in WEB-INF/lib
  The default implementation is log4j, so you don't have to switch to anything else unless 
  you have a good reason.
  The log4j configuration statements have been moved to a separate file log4j.properties, 
  this file should be on your CLASSPATH, by default it is placed in WEB-INF/classes
  
* A new plugin was added that shows you all plugins that are available: PluginIndexPlugin
