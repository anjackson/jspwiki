This is a beta version of JSPWiki 2.4

NEW FEATURES
============

* Authentication and authorization.

* New default template, with pluggable editors.

* New rendering engine, which is WAY faster than the old one (the old one
  is still included for backwards compatibility purposes).

* Loads and loads of under-the-hood changes.

* Atom 1.0 support

UPGRADE NOTES
=============

Upgrading from 2.x:

* Please reinstall in a new directory.  Then move your modified
  templates into the new templates/ -directory.  You MUST
  have the default template in place, else things might not
  work.  If you have modified the default template, please
  rename your old template to "mymodifications" or something.
  You must NOT modify the default template anymore.

* Replace jspwiki.properties with your old configuration file.
  It should run unmodified, though you might want to go through
  the new file to see new options.

* You can copy your old filters.xml to WEB-INF/classes

Upgrading from earlier installations:

* Please make a complete reinstall.  Your wiki pages will still be
  compatible, and the configuration for the most part.

KNOWN MAJOR ISSUES
==================

* Documentation needs cleanup; parts of it are out of date, etc.


EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
=====================

There are some features in this release which could mostly be considered
experimental at best.  The following ones are known to work only 
partially:
  
* WYSIWYG editing.  You need to install FCK by yourself.  It sort of
  works, but not quite.
  
* Install.jsp.  It's still a bit experimental, though it should work...

* WebDAV support.  This is known to be broken on pretty many levels...

* XHTML -> WikiMarkup translation.  Spotty, but should work for the most
  part.
