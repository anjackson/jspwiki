This is a full release of JSPWiki.

Major changes since the last stable (1.6.0) release are:

- Table support.  See TextFormattingRules on how that works.

- Added XML-RPC interface, both strict XML-RPC and one where all
  strings are returned in UTF-8.  See web.xml on ideas how to
  configure them.

- Added CachingProvider based on an idea and sample code by Chris
  Brooking.  Especially when used with RCSFileProvider, this should
  speed up your RecentChanges list considerably.

- Added a VersioningFileProvider for people who don't want to use RCS.
  However, it is currently only for testing - it has not yet been
  tested properly.

- Added ReferenceManager. This object is initialized statically by 
  each WikiEngine, and it keeps track of all WikiPage cross references
  within that WE. This is an unoptimized, in-memory solution, at least
  initially: the WE scans through ALL existing WikiPages when it is 
  created, asks the RM to update itself, and thereafter updates the 
  RM every time a page is saved. 

- New plugin system:  You can now embed any plugin class that
  implements the com.ecyrd.jspwiki.plugin.WikiPlugin interface onto a
  Wiki page just simply by using the command

  [{INSERT <plugin class> WHERE <param1=value1>,<param2=value2>,...}]

  For example, RecentChanges, UnusedPages, UndefinedPages are all done
  this way.

- new property: jspwiki.baseURL for those cases where you need to
  tunnel your Wiki through a firewall or something, using some sort of
  URL rewriting scheme.

- Some UI shortcuts (click on the last modification date to see the
  latest modification, for example).  Also, the layout of the default
  Wiki page has been changed a bit.

- Possibly fixed some problems with RCS and Windows.

- diffs are now colorized for easier reading.  They no longer flow off
  the edge, either. :-)


UPGRADE NOTES
=============

- If updating manually (from v1.6.0).
  - copy all JSP files

  - remove the extra special page entries from jspwiki.properties -
    the only ones you should be left with are "SystemInfo" and "FindPage"
    (except if you have some of your own defined).

  - If you want to use the new XML-RPC interface, make sure you have it
    enabled in your web.xml (see the included web.xml for an example).

  - Remove RecentChanges.jsp - it is no longer required.

  - Copy the new JSPWiki sample pages (LeftMenuFooter, RecentChanges,
    UndefinedPages, UnusedPages are new) into your wiki page repository.

  - Copy all JAR files from WEB-INF/lib to your own WEB-INF/lib

  - Remove your WEB-INF/classes subdirectory.  All classes are now
    contained within JSPWiki.jar in the WEB-INF/lib -directory.

  - Consider moving to use CachingProvider.  See included
    jspwiki.properties.

  - Update the default pages also:
     * TextFormattingRules
