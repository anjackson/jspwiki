This is the first alpha release of JSPWiki 2.6.  As such, this is to be
considered unstable, but feature-complete.

Do not deploy in a production environment, unless you are absolutely sure
of what you are doing.  However, things you *can* be doing are e.g. donating
localizations, testing browser and servlet container compatibility, etc.


NEW FEATURES
============

* JSPWiki source code requires JDK 1.5 to compile, though it should
  still run under JDK 1.4.

* Workflow packages (e.g. for moderating page edits)

* Internationalization

* Spaces in wikinames are now allowed for a more natural-looking page content.
  However, this does not break existing links - but names with spaces are
  preferred.

* Support for new link target types, e.g. [cool link|http://google.com|target='_blank']
  to open the link in a new window.

* SisterSites support

* Local security policies - no more need to use a global security policy
  to configure JSPWiki security!

* Improved SpamFilter, including Captcha support (currently only supports ASIRRA)

* Far improved FCK WYSIWYG editor support

* All new default template with all sorts of awesome goodies, such as upload
  progress indicator, etc!

* No more JAR signing!  Unfortunately, though, if you're running JSPWiki with
  a global security policy, you will still need to sign the JAR yourself using
  the "ant signjar" command.

* WikiCreole 1.0 support in mixed mode.

UPGRADE NOTES
=============

Upgrading from previous releases of 2.4:

* You should be able to just install the JSP files (top-level and
  the default template), and the set of JAR files.

* In addition, please check web.xml for any additional definitions
  that may have been added.

Upgrading from 2.x:

* Please reinstall in a new directory.  Then move your modified
  templates into the new templates/ -directory.  You MUST
  have the default template in place, else things might not
  work.  If you have modified the default template, please
  rename your old template to "mymodifications" or something.
  You must NOT modify the default template anymore.

* Replace jspwiki.properties with your old configuration file.
  It should run unmodified, though you might want to go through
  the new file to see new options.  Most specifically:

  * jspwiki.baseURL is now mandatory

  * jspwiki.workDir is a good idea to set

  * Set jspwiki.security=off, if you don't want JSPWiki to
  use its own security system.  If you do, head over
  to doc.jspwiki.org/2.4 for further instructions.

* You can copy your old filters.xml to WEB-INF/classes

Upgrading from earlier installations:

* Please make a complete reinstall.  Your wiki pages will still be
  compatible, and the configuration for the most part.

Please visit http://doc.jspwiki.org/2.4/ for further instructions.



EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
=====================

There are some features in this release which could mostly be considered
experimental at best.  The following ones are known to work only
partially:

* WebDAV support.  This is known to be broken on pretty many levels...


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

* WebDav and static RSS generation do not yet support the new
  authentication/permissions scheme.  Therefore, if you have very
  sensitive data in your wiki, you might not want to enable these.

* Not all old plugins work.  Specifically, plugins from 2.2, which
  1) use com.ecyrd.jspwiki package, will fail because they are not
     signed with the same key as jspwiki.jar, and
  2) any plugin, which constructs new WikiPages will fail because
     of the constructor has been changed.

* The default template does not work at all if you turn off
  Javascript.  We are aware of this and working on a fix.
