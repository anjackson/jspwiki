This is a CVS release of JSPWiki.

Major changes since the last stable (1.8.0) release are:

- Support for traditional WikiLinks without square brackets
  (InterCapping, BumpyWords, CamelCase, ...)

- Splitting of Wiki pages into "Controller" and "View" pages has begun.

- New plugins:
   * IndexPlugin (by Alain Ravet)

UPGRADE NOTES
=============

- If updating manually (from v1.8.0):

  * Providers now sleep in a different package.  You must change your
    "jspwiki.pageProvider" setting.

  * CachingProvider is no longer set explicitly.  You must use the new
    "jspwiki.usePageCache" property instead.

  * All HTML code should now go into ViewTemplate.jsp instead of Wiki.jsp.
