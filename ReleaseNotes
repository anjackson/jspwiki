This is a beta release of JSPWiki 2.8!

This is the first version of JSPWiki which is released completely under
the Apache License.  This is done as a part of the transition to the
Apache Incubation.

However, this is NOT an Apache release - JSPWiki 3.0 will be the first
official Apache release.

Please report any issues you can find at http://issues.apache.org/JIRA/


NEW FEATURES
============

* JSPWiki now requires JDK 1.5 to run.

* Simplified Chinese, Dutch and Italian localizations added!

* There is no more need for JAAS files!  Hooray!  This has
  been replaced with custom jspwiki properties.

* Massive improvements to the default template, like
  section editing.
  
* Sneak preview in the default editor

* WikiWizard is removed (it is LGPL), but FCK integration is available,
  and WikiWizard can still be installed as a separate package.

* German language corepages

UPGRADE NOTES
=============

Please see the UPGRADING document in this same directory.


EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
=====================

There are some features in this release which could mostly be considered
experimental at best.  The following ones are known to work only
partially:

* WebDAV support.  This is known to be broken on pretty many levels...

* Admin interface.  Check out /admin/Admin.jsp.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

* WebDav does not yet support the new
  authentication/permissions scheme.  Therefore, if you have very
  sensitive data in your wiki, you might not want to enable it.

* Not all old plugins work.  Specifically, plugins from 2.2, which
  1) use com.ecyrd.jspwiki package, will fail because they are not
     signed with the same key as jspwiki.jar, and
  2) any plugin, which constructs new WikiPages will fail because
     of the constructor has been changed.

* Our documentation simply sucks at this point.  Please forgive us,
  and point where those fixes are needed.  We will improve upon
  this during our progress towards a stable.

* The ShortURLConstructor does not work reliably.  Please use
  ShortViewURLConstructor, or Apache mod_rewrite.
