// This file contains the Java 2 security policy for JSPWiki.
// It provides the permissions rules for the JSPWiki
// environment, and should be suitable for most 
// purposes.
//
// If you are running your servlet container with a security
// policy already, you should simply append the contents
// of this file to it. Otherwise, you can simply use this
// as a stand-alone policy, even without running a 
// security manager.
//
// You make this policy active, you will need to specify 
// the location of this file by setting the JVM system property
// 'java.security.policy' in the command line script you
// use to start your web container. The file location should
// be the absolute path to the jspwiki.policy file. For example:
//
//   java -jar myservletcontainer.jar -Djava.security.policy=/path-to/jspwiki.policy
// 
// Some servlet containers make this very easy by looking
// for an environment variable and automatically appending
// the contents to the 'java' command. For example, Tomcat
// users just need to set the CATALINA_OPTS variable:
// 
//   export CATALINA_OPTS="-Djava.security.policy=/path-to/jspwiki.policy"
//
// In addition, it is typically good practice to store jspwiki.policy
// in the Tomcat config directory (CATALINA_HOME/conf).
//

// And now, for the security policy

// Unauthenticted users are allowed to view all pages. If you don't
// want anonymous users to be able to view pages, or if you
// need "strict logins," comment out or delete this entry.

// minimally-authenticated users to view and edit any page,
// as well as create new pages, comment and upload files.
