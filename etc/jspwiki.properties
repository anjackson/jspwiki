#
#  This is the JSPWiki configuration file.  You'll need to edit this
#  a bit.  The first few lines are the most important ones.
#
#
#  You can use this to override the default application name.  It affects
#  the HTML titles and logging, for example.  It can be different from
#  the actual web name (http://my.com/mywiki) of the application, but usually
#  it is the same.
#
jspwiki.applicationName = JSPWiki

#
#  Which page provider class to use.  Possibilities are:
#
#    RCSFileProvider for simple RCS-based file storage
#    FileSystemProvider for simple pure file storage with no version information
#    CachingProvider for a memory cache
#
jspwiki.pageProvider = com.ecyrd.jspwiki.FileSystemProvider

#
#  Set this to the real provider you want to use if you are
#  using the caching provider.
#
#jspwiki.cachingProvider.realProvider = com.ecyrd.jspwiki.FileSystemProvider

#
#  Determines where wiki files are kept for FileSystemProvider
#  and RCSFileProvider
#
#  If you're using Windows, then you must duplicate the backslashes.
#  For example, use:
#  
#  jspwiki.fileSystemProvider.pageDir = C:\\Data\\jspwiki
#
jspwiki.fileSystemProvider.pageDir = /p/web/www-data/jspwiki/

#
#  BaseURL can be used to rewrite all of JSPWiki's internal references.
#  Sometimes, especially if you're behind a address-rewriting firewall,
#  relative URLs don't work since the servlet container has no idea
#  where it's actually located.
#
#  Leave undefined if you want to rely on what your servlet container
#  thinks of where your application lives.  For most applications,
#  you can just leave this out.
#
#jspwiki.baseURL=

#
#  Determines which character encoding JSPWiki should use.  If you want
#  to support all languages in your Wiki, you probably want to enable
#  this.  If you're upgrading, or are planning just to use the ISO-Latin1
#  character set (like most western people would), you can just leave
#  it at the default.  If you enable it, remember that most people won't
#  be able to type in special characters anyway.
#  
#  Note that you can't switch these in the mean time, since the way the
#  files are encoded on disk is incompatible between ISO-Latin1 and UTF-8.
#  Don't try.  You'll get all sorts of interesting problems, if you do.
#
#  Possible values are 'ISO-8859-1' (default) and 'UTF-8'.

#jspwiki.encoding = UTF-8

#
#  Special page references.
#
#  The URL is relative to Wiki.jsp.  However, if you use
#  a full, absolute URL, you can also do that.
#
# Example to redirect all requests to a page called 'OriginalWiki'
# to the original wikiwiki at http://c2.com/cgi/wiki
#
# jspwiki.specialPage.OriginalWiki = http://c2.com/cgi/wiki
#
#  Note that it is entirely possible to override any Wiki page, even
#  an existing one by redefining it here.
#
jspwiki.specialPage.FindPage = Search.jsp
jspwiki.specialPage.SystemInfo = SystemInfo.jsp

#############################################################################
#
# InterWiki links 
#
# The %s is replaced with the page reference (specify
# multiple times to get multiple references).  Page references should
# appear in format : [wiki:wikipage].  
#
# This is the JSPWiki home.  In future, JSPWiki will probably rely on this
# for error messages, so I don't recommend that you use it.
jspwiki.interWikiRef.JSPWiki = http://www.ecyrd.com/JSPWiki/Wiki.jsp?page=%s

# Here's how you can have directly links to the JSPWiki editor.
# Now you can put a hyperlink for editing "MainPage" by making 
# a link [Edit:MainPage].
jspwiki.interWikiRef.Edit = Edit.jsp?page=%s

#  This is the original WikiWikiWeb
jspwiki.interWikiRef.WikiWikiWeb = http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?%s

#
# Define which image types are inlined.
# These are your standard glob expressions (just like in your
# Windows or UNIX shells).  Default pattern is to include all PNG
# images.  If you specify something here, you will override the default.
#
# Don't forget to increase the number after the dot - duplicate entries 
# cause problems!
#
# For example:
#   Inline all JPG files, PNG files and all files from images.com:
#
#      jspwiki.translatorReader.inlinePattern.1 = *.jpg
#      jspwiki.translatorReader.inlinePattern.2 = *.png
#      jspwiki.translatorReader.inlinePattern.3 = http://images.com/*

###########################################################################
#
#  Determine how certain file commands are run.  They have been
#  commented out, since most likely you want to use the defaults.
#  Be warned, making mistakes with these may well ruin your entire
#  Wiki collection!
#
#  The command to run diff:
#jspwiki.diffCommand = diff -u %s1 %s2

#  The command for RCS checkin
#jspwiki.rcsFileProvider.checkinCommand = ci -q -mx -l -t-none %s

#  The command for RCS checkout of the newest version
#jspwiki.rcsFileProvider.checkoutCommand = co -l %s

#  The command for checking out a specific version (%v = version number)
#jspwiki.rcsFileProvider.checkoutVersionCommand = co -p -r1.%v %s

#  The command for RCS log headers
#jspwiki.rcsFileProvider.logCommand = rlog -zLT -h %s

#  The command for getting the entire modification history
#jspwiki.rcsFileProvider.fullLogCommand = rlog -zLT %s
