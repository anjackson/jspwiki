This is a feature release of JSPWiki.

Major changes since the last release are:

* Page names can now contain also underscores and dots (_ and .)

* You can now specify using regular expressions which images are
  automatically included in the page when you make a hyperlink to
  them.  Check out the jspwiki.properties file for examples.

* You can now have list items (for the * and # lists) spanning
  multiple lines if you align the lines with spaces (like these lines
  here).

* The sample pages included with this package have been rewritten.
