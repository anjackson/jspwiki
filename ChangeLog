        * Removed SkipHTMLIterator because it was a bad idea.  No
        InterCapped hyperlinks are available.

        * Fixed tests so that they now actually run.  This required a new
        constructor for WikiEngine.

        * TranslatorWriter.cleanLink() now removes all non-letters and
        non-numbers from the link name so that you can use all sorts of
        punctuation inside a link name.

        * Implemented RecentChanges list by writing RecentChanges.jsp.
        Wiki.jsp also redirects all requests to a page called
        'RecentChanges' to RecentChanges.jsp.

        * Added configuration at etc/jspwiki.properties.

        * Added this file.
