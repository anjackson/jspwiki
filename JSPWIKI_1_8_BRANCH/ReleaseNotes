This is a full release of JSPWiki.

Major changes since the last stable (1.8.1) release are:

* Some bug fixes, see ChangeLog.

* Added ability to add providers without package names.


UPGRADE NOTES
=============

- If updating manually (from v1.8.1):

  * Unzip WAR-file, copy JSPWiki.jar into WEB-INF/lib.

  * NO NEED to change any JSP-files.

- Note that 1.8.0 is exactly the same as 1.8.1, so if you're running
  that version, you can safely upgrade.
