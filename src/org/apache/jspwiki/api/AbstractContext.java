/**

 *  This mostly replaces the old WikiContext class.  The reason is that WikiContext
 *  always needs a WikiPage, but since 2.4 we've had quite a few non-page contexts
 *  like group editing and so on.  For these pages, it is unnecessary to carry
 *  the WikiPage all around.
 *  <p>
 *  WikiContext still stays the main interface for third party developers (e.g. plugins
