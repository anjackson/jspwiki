 * <p>
 * Groups are a specialized type of ad-hoc role used by the wiki system. Unlike
 * externally-provided roles (such as those provided by an LDAP server or web
 * container), JSPWiki groups can be created dynamically by wiki users, without
 * requiring special container privileges or administrator intervention. They
 * are designed to provide a lightweight role-based access control system that
 * complements existing role systems.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Group names are case-insensitive, and have a few naming restrictions, which
 * are enforced by the {@link GroupManager}:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Groups cannot have the same name as a built-in Role (e.g., "Admin",
 * "Authenticated" etc.)</li>
 * <li>Groups cannot have the same name as an existing user</li>
