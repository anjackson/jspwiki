/**
 *  WatchDog is a general system watchdog.  You can attach any Watchable
 *  or a Thread object to it, and it will notify you if a timeout has been
 *  exceeded.
 *  <p>
 *  The notification of the timeouts is done from a separate WatchDog thread,
 *  of which there is one per watched thread.  This Thread is named 'WatchDog for
 *  XXX', where XXX is your Thread name.
 *  <p>
 *  The suggested method of obtaining a WatchDog is via the static factory
 *  method, since it will return you the correct watchdog for the current
 *  thread.  However, we do not prevent you from creating your own watchdogs
 *  either.
 *  <p>
 *  If you create a WatchDog for a Thread, the WatchDog will figure out when
 *  the Thread is dead, and will stop itself accordingly.  However, this object
 *  is not automatically released, so you might want to check it out after a while.
