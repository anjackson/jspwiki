!!Editing the menu on the left hand side

The menu on the left hand side (over there <--) is just a standard Wiki page, called [LeftMenu].

If you (the administrator) don't want anyone else to modify it, you can always edit [LeftMenu], then make the page read-only on the hard drive itself ;-).

The lower part of the left hand side is similarly called [LeftMenuFooter], and it is fully editable as well.

!!Editing pages directly

By setting up an InterWiki link called "Edit" in {{jspwiki.properties}} you can make direct edit links.  For example, this link here (assuming you're using the default configuration from the JSPWiki archive), will take you
to the edit mode of this page: [Edit:JSPWikiTips].

The magical incantation in the {{jspwiki.properties}} file is:
{{{
jspwiki.interWikiRef.Edit = Edit.jsp?page=%s
}}}
