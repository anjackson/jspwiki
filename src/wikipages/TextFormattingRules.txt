When you've figured out how the editor works, then you should read
[WikiEtiquette] so that you would know how to use your newly acquired
skills...

!Quick reference

{{{
---- = Make a horizontal ruler. Extra '-' is ignored.
\\ = force a line break
[link] = creates a hyperlink to an internal WikiPage called 'Link'.
[this is also a link] = creates a hyperlink to an internal WikiPage called
'ThisIsAlsoALink'.
[click here|link] = creates a hyperlink to an internal WikiPage called
'Link', but displays the text 'click here' to the
user instead of 'Link'.
[[link] = creates text '[link]'.
!heading = small heading with text 'heading'
!!heading = medium heading with text 'heading'
!!!heading = large heading with text 'heading'
''text'' = prints 'text' in italic.
__text__ = prints 'text' in bold.
{{text}} = prints 'text' in monospaced font.
* text = makes a bulleted list item with 'text'
# text = makes a numbered list item with 'text'
}}}

!Hyperlinks

The link can also be a direct URL starting with http:, ftp:, mailto:,
https:, or news:, in which case the link points to an external
entity. For example, to point at the java.sun.com home page, use
[[http://java.sun.com], which becomes [http://java.sun.com/] or [[Java
home page|http://java.sun.com], which becomes [Java home
page|http://java.sun.com].

To add a new page you just create a link to it from somewhere
else. After all, there isn't much point in having a page if you can't
access it! You'll then see a small question mark after the page name
when you return to that page. Then click on it and you have created a
new page!

!Bulleted lists

Use an asterisk (*) in the first column to make bulleted lists. Use
more asterisks for deeper indentation. Each item must be on a single
line. For example:

{{{
* One
* Two
* Three
** Three.One}}}

creates
* One
* Two
* Three
** Three.One

!Numbered lists
Just like with bulleted lists, but use a hash (#) instead of the asterisk. Like this:
{{{
# One
# Two
# Three
## Three.One
}}}

creates
# One
# Two
# Three
## Three.One


!Text effects

You may use __bold__ text or ''italic'' text, by using two underscores
(_) and two single quotes ('), respectively. If you're on a Windows
computer, make sure that you are using the correct quote sign, as
there is one that looks the same, but really isn't.


!Preformatted text

If you want to add preformatted text (like code) just use three
consecutive braces ({) to open a block, and three consecutive braces
(}) to close a block. Edit this page for an example.

!Conflicts

If someone happens to edit the same page as you at the same time,
JSPWiki will prevent you from doing changes and show a conflict page
instead. Sorry to say, but the first one to make changes wins...

__A word of warning:__ If you use the Back button of your browser to
go into the Edit page, you will almost certainly get a conflict. This
is because the browser thinks its still editing an earlier copy of the
page.

!Deleting pages

This is not possible. You can, of course, remove all the links to that
page, which makes it inaccesible. Or you can [email
me|mailto:jalkanen+jspwiki@regex.fi], and I'll remove the page.

!Adding new pages

Create a link that points to a new (not existing) page using its
[WikiName].  Click that new link, which should now have a question
mark (?) suffix and you will get an editor for the new page.
