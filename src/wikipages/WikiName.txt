WikiNames are traditionally written using InterCapping, so that making hyperlinks is really easy.

However, in this [WikiWiki] the links are written only using the [[link] notation, as the original InterCapping style of linking is, IMHO, slightly confusing.  The names still conform to the [WikiWiki] standard, if you look at the URL at the top.

Names are ''crushed'', i.e. [[This is a link] becomes [[ThisIsALink].  Also, links such as [[this_is_a_link] becomes also [[ThisIsALink].
