!!Log4j Problem

Q: I installed jspwiki and everything seems to work fine. But I actually have a problem with log4j The entries in the local {{jspwiki.properties}} don't seem to work. To be shure I removed the system wide log4j and its property file. This was also another version, 1.2.8. Then I started Tomcat again. No log file was created. Used existing path without typo. The following message was to be found in {{launcher.server.log}}:

{{log4j:ERROR No appenders could be found for category (com.ecyrd.jspwiki.WikiEngine).
log4j:ERROR Please initialize the log4j system properly.}}

The log4j lines in {{{jspwiki.properties

log4j.appender.FileLog = org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.FileLog.MaxFileSize    = 10MB
log4j.appender.FileLog.MaxBackupIndex = 14
log4j.appender.FileLog.File = d:\\webapps\\jspwiki\\_log\\jspwiki.log
log4j.appender.FileLog.layout = org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.FileLog.layout.ConversionPattern=%d [%t] %p %c %x - %m%n}}}

everything else concerning log4j in {{jspwiki.properties}} is commented out. Have you got any idea, please?

After installing, I found that the first line was "log4j.appender.filelog...". Note the lowercase f and l in filelog. Also, a few lines below the appender block you should have a line starting as "log4j.rootCategory=INFO,FileLog". The FileLog should be the same as it is for the above appender lines. This resolved the problem, you mention, for me.

!!Log4j DNS lookups taking lots of time

Some time below, somebody complained about a terribly slowly running JSPWiki - I ran into a similar situation: after having successfully installed JSPWiki 1.8.2 within a [LiteWebserver|http://www.gefionsoftware.com] I observed long delays between an HTTP request and the corresponding response from the server (30 seconds and more) - surprisingly, the whole(!) server was blocked during that time, i.e., concurrent requests with other URIs (I'm using that server for a HTML wrapping facility based on servlets which I wrote myself) did not proceed as well!

I then figured out, that the delay might have been caused by problems with DNS lookups (the method HttpRequest.getRemoteHost took very long to complete) and switching off DNS immediately solved the problem.

Consequence: you may not have to switch off DNS resolution yourself (I just used this to verify my assumption), but you may want to change your DNS servers or help your system with a local "hosts" file...

Hoping that this remark is of any help...

You may be right. There should be an option to disable DNS queries (which incidentally, are currently
only used by the logging routines. Duh. Perhaps I should just disable them completely.)

Hmmm, can I disable logging by {{log4j}} somehow? This package was the one
which caused most of the trouble when installing JSPWiki on my LiteWebServer...

Simple: Look at the jspwiki.properties, right at the end. Comment out anything that has anything to do log4j, and you should be set. Unfortunately, since string concatenation is done ''before'' the logging, you'll still get the DNS resolution. Easiest is to remove the offending statements from the JSP pages.
