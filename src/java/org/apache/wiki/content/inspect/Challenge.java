/**
 * <p>
 * Describes how Challenge classes should implement scripting and processing
 * methods to test particular Challenge schemes, such as CAPTCHA.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Challenge specifies three logical states, which are invoked by a combination
 * of custom JSP tags and the {@link SpamInterceptor} interceptor.
 * </p>
 * <ol>
 * <li><strong>formContent</strong>. When a JSP containing a &lt;SpamProtect&gt;
 * tag is encountered, the {@link SpamProtectTag#doEndTag()} method calls
 * {@link #formContent(WikiActionBeanContext)} to generate any content needed to be
 * included in the &lt;form&gt; element of the page. Note that the
 * &lt;SpamProtect&gt tag is not actually guaranteed to be inside of the form
 * element, but in practice, it should be.</li>
 * <li><strong>check</strong>. This method provides any back-end Challenge
 * processing that the implementation might need when the form contents are
 * posted, for example calling out to a remote service. It is invoked as part of
 * the content-inspection chain called by {@link SpamInterceptor}, which itself
 * is triggered whenever a Stripes event method with a {@link SpamProtect}
 * annotation is called. Implementations only need to return a simple boolean
 * value: {@code true} means the user passed the test; {@code false} means
 * failure.</li>
