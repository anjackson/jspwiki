This is the second stable release of JSPWiki v2.  It contains a few
bugfixes over the last stable version:

Most of the documentation is now contained in jspwiki_samplepages.zip

Major changes since the last stable (2.0.36) release are:

* Searching should now be a lot faster, thanks to Erik Bunn.

* CheckLockTag was a bit inconsistent: if the page was locked by the
  current user, it would of course always be "locked".  This means
  that the value of "unlocked" was essentially useless for Edit pages.
  I added a new value for "mode": "owned".

* Added Image plugin from 2.1.x branch.

* Bug fix: FileSystemProvider did not close file handles properly.
  This could use up your available file handles pretty quickly until
  the next garbage collection.

* RecentChangesPlugin did not heed jspwiki.baseURL.  Oops.

* Bug fix: If the user name was received from container, JSPWiki would
  get confused if it contained spaces.


UPGRADE NOTES
=============


- If updating manually (from v1.8.x):

  * Providers now sleep in a different package.  You must change your
    "jspwiki.pageProvider" setting.

  * CachingProvider is no longer set explicitly.  You must use the new
    "jspwiki.usePageCache" property instead.

  * All HTML code should now go into *Template.jsp instead of Wiki.jsp
    and the other main JSP pages.

  * SystemInfo.jsp is gone.  Instead, there is now a page called
    "SystemInfo".

  So, the best way to do the update is to simply save your
  "jspwiki.properties", and "web.xml" files to some safe location,
  DELETE your previous installation, and install it again from
  scratch. However, after this your templates should be easily
  modifiable, and you never again have to resort to such drastic
  measures again... We hope.

- If updating manually from 2.0.36:

  * Copy the new JSPWiki.jar into your WEB-INF/lib and restart
    your servlet container.

  * Copy the JSP pages in the JSPWiki distribution into your webapp
    directory.  You don't have to touch the templates.
