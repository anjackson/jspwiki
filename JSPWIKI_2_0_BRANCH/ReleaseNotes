This is the first stable release of JSPWiki v2.  It contains many new
enhancements and fixes, so please do read these carefully!

Most of the documentation is now contained in jspwiki_samplepages.zip

Major changes since the last stable (1.8.2) release are:

- Support for traditional WikiLinks without square brackets
  (InterCapping, BumpyWords, CamelCase, ...)

- Splitting of Wiki pages into "Controller" and "View" pages has
  been done.  The user-modifiable HTML templates can be found in
  "templates/default" -directory.  All functionality can now be
  controlled using JSP tags.  You can see their documentation on the
  page JSPWikiTags

- There is now a fully-fledged templating system, allowing you to
  create your own look-and-feel for the Wiki quite easily.

- There is a new addition to WikiLanguage: Definition lists
  ;term;definition.  You can use this to make comments, too, by using
  an empty 'term': ;:Comment.

- There is a new variable system, documented in WikiVariables.

- It is now possible to restore old versions of pages easily.  See
  the page history page.

- Default Edit window background has been changed :-)

- Many pages have had slight changes to the way they look.

- UserPreferences now checks for username validity. 

- CachingProvider is now used by default.

- There is now full attachment support.  See WikiAttachments

- It is now possible to use HTML also in the Wiki markup.  However,
  you must turn this feature explicitly on in the jspwiki.properties
  file, as it potentially allows your users to create damaging pages.

- Page "locking" has been implemented.  All edits are tracked, and the
  default template issues a warning, if there are potentially
  conflicting edits.

- New plugins (which can now be multiline).

   * Counter
   * WeblogPlugin
   * WeblogEntryPlugin



UPGRADE NOTES
=============


- If updating manually (from v1.8.x):

  * Providers now sleep in a different package.  You must change your
    "jspwiki.pageProvider" setting.

  * CachingProvider is no longer set explicitly.  You must use the new
    "jspwiki.usePageCache" property instead.

  * All HTML code should now go into *Template.jsp instead of Wiki.jsp
    and the other main JSP pages.

  * SystemInfo.jsp is gone.  Instead, there is now a page called
    "SystemInfo".

  So, the best way to do the update is to simply save your
  "jspwiki.properties", and "web.xml" files to some safe location,
  DELETE your previous installation, and install it again from
  scratch. However, after this your templates should be easily
  modifiable, and you never again have to resort to such drastic
  measures again... We hope.
