This is the third stable release of JSPWiki v2.  It contains a few
bugfixes over the last stable version:

Most of the documentation is now contained in jspwiki_samplepages.zip

Major changes since the last stable (2.0.39) release are:

* CalendarTag monthly navigation has been backported from 2.1 branch.

* Fixed jspwiki.tld, which was causing problems to a bunch of people.

* A bunch of bugfixes and enhancements to the RSS Generator.
  * You can now see the diffs as well.
  * Attachment URLs were wrong.
  * RSS generator now separates cleanly between attachments and pages.

* out.png is now transparent.

* CheckLockTag would sometimes create an NullPointerException.

* Wiki.jsp is a bit more stable against bad pagenames.


UPGRADE NOTES
=============


- If updating manually (from v1.8.x):

  * Providers now sleep in a different package.  You must change your
    "jspwiki.pageProvider" setting.

  * CachingProvider is no longer set explicitly.  You must use the new
    "jspwiki.usePageCache" property instead.

  * All HTML code should now go into *Template.jsp instead of Wiki.jsp
    and the other main JSP pages.

  * SystemInfo.jsp is gone.  Instead, there is now a page called
    "SystemInfo".

  So, the best way to do the update is to simply save your
  "jspwiki.properties", and "web.xml" files to some safe location,
  DELETE your previous installation, and install it again from
  scratch. However, after this your templates should be easily
  modifiable, and you never again have to resort to such drastic
  measures again... We hope.

- If updating manually from 2.0.36-39:

  * Copy the new JSPWiki.jar into your WEB-INF/lib and restart
    your servlet container.

  * Copy the JSP pages in the JSPWiki distribution into your webapp
    directory.  You don't have to touch the templates.

  * Copy the images/out.png to your images/out.png
