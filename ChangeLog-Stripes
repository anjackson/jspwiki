        * Merged with trunk 2.6.2-svn-2 (revisions 630646:630650)
        
        * Added ChangeLog-Stripes to keep track of Stripes-related changes separately.
        Note to self: when merging from trunk, each "Merged with trunk" entry
        assumes merging from this branch:
        
        https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/jspwiki/trunk
        
        ...and each entry will specify the revisions it merges from and to (from:to).
