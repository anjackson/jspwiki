This is an experimental branch of JSPWiki.  It's sole purpose is
to experiment with multiwiki -capability for JSPWiki 2.6.  It is
unoptimized and unstable.

THIS IS EXPERIMENTAL, AND IS NOT SUPPORTED.  THE REAL MULTIWIKI
CAPABILITY IS SLATED FOR 3.0, AND WILL SUBSTANTIALLY BE DIFFERENT
FROM THIS.

The only thing which will probably be carried across to 3.0 are
the URL schemes and some helper classes.

NEW FEATURES
============

* MultiWiki support

UPGRADE NOTES
=============

* You *MUST* create a new directory to store your pages in.  If you
  are currently storing your pages in "/tmp/mypages", then you
  must create a new directory called "/tmp/mypages/Main", and move
  *all* files from /tmp/mypages into the /tmp/mypages/Main directory.
  Do *not* change jspwiki.fileSystemProvider.pageDir, nor the
  attachment directory.


EXPERIMENTAL FEATURES
=====================

There are some features in this release which could mostly be considered
experimental at best.  The following ones are known to work only
partially:

* WebDAV support.  This is known to be broken on pretty many levels...


KNOWN PROBLEMS
==============

* WebDav and static RSS generation do not yet support the new
  authentication/permissions scheme.  Therefore, if you have very
  sensitive data in your wiki, you might not want to enable these.

* Not all old plugins work.  Specifically, plugins from 2.2, which
  1) use com.ecyrd.jspwiki package, will fail because they are not
     signed with the same key as jspwiki.jar, and
  2) any plugin, which constructs new WikiPages will fail because
     of the constructor has been changed.

* The default template does not work at all if you turn off
  Javascript.  We are aware of this and working on a fix.

* The editor suggestion list is not yet properly integrated.

* GroupTab is missing.

* Brushed javascript editor is not yet completely ported

* Our documentation simply sucks at this point.  Please forgive us,
  and point where those fixes are needed.  We will improve upon
  this during our progress towards a stable.
