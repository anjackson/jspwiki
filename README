What is it?
-----------

JSPWiki is a very simple WikiWiki clone.  It keeps all of its
formatting in JSP files, and uses a custom Java class called
'com.ecyrd.jspwiki.WikiEngine' to all interfacing with the Wiki
system.

(No, the GPL does not mean that all the content in your new wiki will
be under the GPL, anymore than any text you write using Emacs becomes
GPL.)

One small request I have.  If you really, really like this software,
donate a small amount of money to the World Wildlife Foundation
(WWF), Free Software Foundation (FSF), or Electronic Freedom
Foundation (EFF), or whichever charity is close to your heart.

The world doesn't need to become a bad place.


Installation
------------

First, install a JSP engine and a web server.  You can download Tomcat
from http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat/.  This software was built
originally on top of Tomcat 3.2.2, but probably most other versions
work, too, and most other JSP containers.

After you've installed the engine and checked that it works, you just
make a subdirectory under $TOMCAT_HOME/webapps/.  For example, if you
want your application to be called 'MyWiki', just create a directory
called 'MyWiki', then extract all files from the war files into that
directory, preserving the directory structure.

Edit the WEB-INF/jspwiki.properties file to your liking.  The only
thing you need to set is the directory where you want your wiki pages
to be stored.  I recommend a directory that is regularly backed up.

(Re)start tomcat.

Point your browser at http://<where your Tomcat is installed>/MyWiki/.
You should see the Main Wiki page.


Notes:
~~~~~~

Feel free to edit the JSP pages anyway you like.  Just don't touch any
of the Java code, unless you know what you're doing, because otherwise
the Wiki might stop to work.  Most modern HTML editors are smart
enough not to mess with the JSP tags (all the stuff between <% and
%>).

While Tomcat is also a fully featured Web server, it is not
particularly fast.  You might also have a web server already running.
Tomcat does integrate itself pretty well with existing web servers,
such as Apache, so you can just see the instructions at
http://jakarta.apache.org/ to see how to get Tomcat and Apache talking
to each other using mod_jk.  (Don't use mod_jserv, it's outdated and
confusing.)



Files
-----

Files are kept in a subdirectory, which is defined in the
jspwiki.properties file.  All files are in text format (usually in the
system's native format), with a file ending defined in
WikiEngine.java.  This is ".txt" by default.

There are some default files with the distribution archive.  Feel free
to use them to bootstrap your own Wiki.
